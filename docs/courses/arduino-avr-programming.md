## Arduino C Is a Childâ€™s Programming Language

Now before you get your pitchforks and torches out, please let me explain.
I think that Arduino C is an excellent programming language, its easy to learn, easy to work with, and has safety features to stop you from doing something really stupid.
That being said, Arduino C has its purpose: serve as a platform of entry into programming microcontrollers.
What I'm trying to hint here is to use the right tool for the job, Arduino C is meant for learning and prototyping, not production.
