# Programming Environment

Probably one of the most controversial topics in programming is your choice of text editor.
Finding the right text editor can seem like a daunting task with all the options out there.
If you're a complete beginner, use the Arduino IDE, it has everything you'll need to get started with Arduino C.

If you're in the business of looking for a text editor, I **highly** recommend settling on an extensible text editor like Vim or Emacs.
The reasoning behind using an extensible text editor is that you can tailor it to your liking.
Of course, this comes as a time investment, but rightfully so, in the end, you get something that behaves *exactly* as you like it.
If you don't believe that this investment is work the time, at least spend a little time in your current editor to tune in the settings just like you like it.
Remember, you're going to be spending hours in this environment.
