# Arduino Software

Ah, the initial test: getting the software required for the rest of this course.
You're a bit in luck because there are more or less just two options when it comes to the Arduino software you'll need to install.
The first of the two is the standard Arduino IDE, which has everything you'll need to program Arduinos.
If you're a bit more advanced and comfortable with the terminal than I recommend going for the Arduino CLI.
Both options have their pros and cons, research both and make a decision that is best for you.

=== "Arduino IDE"

	=== "Windows"

		Installing the Arduino IDE on Windows is easy.
		Just head over to the [software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on the official Arduino website and download the appropriate binary.

		For further clarification, read the official [install instuctions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/windows).

	=== "Mac OS"

		Installing the Arduino IDE on Mac OS is easy.
		Just head over to the [software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on the official Arduino website and download the appropriate binary.

		For further clarification, read the official [install instuctions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/macOSX).

	=== "Linux"

		If you're running Linux, I'll make the safe assumption that you know what you're doing and know how to install the Arduino IDE using your package manager or building it from source.
		If not, head over to the [software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on the official Arduino website and download the appropriate archive for your architecture.
		Then extract the downloaded archive and run the install script.

		!!! attention
			You might need to add your user account to the appropriate user groups to access serial ports on your system.
