# Arduino Software

Ah, the initial test: getting the software required for the rest of this course.
You're a bit in luck because there are more or less just two options when it comes to the Arduino software you'll need to install.
The first of the two is the standard Arduino IDE, which has everything you'll need to program Arduinos.
If you're a bit more advanced and comfortable with the terminal than I recommend going for the Arduino CLI.
Both options have their pros and cons, research both and make a decision that is best for you.
